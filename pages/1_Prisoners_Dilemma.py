    The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most famous games in game theory. It demonstrates 
    why two rational individuals might not cooperate even when it would be in their best interest to do so.

        **The Story:**
        Two prisoners are arrested and held in separate cells. They cannot communicate with each other. 
        Each prisoner has two options: Cooperate (remain silent) or Defect (betray the other).
        
        **The Dilemma:**
        - If both cooperate: Both get a light sentence
        - If both defect: Both get a heavy sentence  
        - If one defects and one cooperates: The defector goes free, the cooperator gets the worst sentence
        
        **Key Insight:**
        Even though mutual cooperation gives a better outcome than mutual defection, 
        the rational choice for each individual prisoner is to defect.
