### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Web browser for the interactive interface

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure R is installed on your system
3. No additional R packages required - uses base R only

### Running the Application

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Run the interactive R application
Rscript game_theory.R

# Or start R and source the file
R
> source("game_theory.R")
> run_game_theory_app()
```

#### Web Interface
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Interact with the game theory examples
3. Use the custom game analyzer to create your own scenarios

## üìä Game Theory Concepts

### Nash Equilibrium
A strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

### Pure vs Mixed Strategies
- **Pure Strategy**: Playing a single strategy with certainty
- **Mixed Strategy**: Randomizing between strategies with specific probabilities

### Game Types Demonstrated
- **Coordination Games**: Players benefit from coordinating (Battle of the Sexes)
- **Prisoner's Dilemmas**: Individual rationality leads to collective irrationality
- **Zero-Sum Games**: One player's gain equals another's loss (Rock-Paper-Scissors)

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Nash Equilibrium Algorithm
The application implements the standard algorithm for finding Nash equilibria in 2x2 games:

1. **Pure Strategy Equilibria**: Check each strategy profile to see if any player wants to deviate
2. **Mixed Strategy Equilibria**: Solve the indifference conditions for each player

### Mathematical Foundation
For a 2x2 game with payoff matrices:
- Player 1's mixed strategy probability: Derived from Player 2's indifference condition
- Player 2's mixed strategy probability: Derived from Player 1's indifference condition
- Expected payoffs calculated using probability distributions

## üìù Examples

### Prisoner's Dilemma Analysis
```
Strategy 1: Cooperate, Strategy 2: Defect

Player 1 Payoffs:         Player 2 Payoffs:
     C    D                    C    D  
C   [3]  [0]               C   [3]  [5]
D   [5]  [1]               D   [0]  [1]

Nash Equilibrium: (Defect, Defect) = (1, 1)
```

### Custom Game Creation
Use the web interface or R commands to create custom games:
```r
# Create a custom game
payoff <- create_payoff_matrix(2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2)
equilibria <- find_nash_equilibria(payoff)
mixed_eq <- find_mixed_nash(payoff)
```
