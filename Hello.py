        This application demonstrates fundamental concepts in **Game Theory** through interactive examples.
        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a demo from the sidebar** to explore different game theory concepts!
        
        ### Available Demos:
        - **Prisoner's Dilemma** - Classic two-player game demonstrating strategic interaction
        - **Nash Equilibrium** - Find equilibrium points in 2x2 games
        - **Mixed Strategy** - Calculate optimal mixed strategies
        - **Evolutionary Games** - Simulate population dynamics
        
        ### What is Game Theory?
        Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic decision making among rational agents. 
        It has applications in economics, political science, biology, and computer science.
        
        ### Key Concepts:
        - **Nash Equilibrium**: A solution concept where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy
        - **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that yields the best outcome regardless of what opponents do
        - **Zero-Sum Games**: Games where one player's gain equals another's loss
        - **Mixed Strategies**: Randomizing over pure strategies with certain probabilities
