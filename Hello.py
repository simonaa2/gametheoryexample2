        Welcome to our interactive Game Theory Applications!
        
        This application provides tools to analyze and understand various concepts in game theory.
        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select an application from the sidebar** to explore different game theory scenarios:
        
        ### Available Applications:
        - **Nash Equilibrium Calculator** - Find Nash equilibria in strategic form games
        - **Prisoner's Dilemma** - Interactive prisoner's dilemma game simulation
        - **Strategic Form Games** - Analyze payoff matrices and dominant strategies
        - **Mixed Strategy Calculator** - Calculate optimal mixed strategies
        
        ### About Game Theory:
        Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic decision making among rational agents. 
        It provides tools for understanding situations where the outcome for each participant 
        depends on the actions of all participants.
        
        ### Key Concepts:
        - **Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where no player can improve by unilaterally changing strategy
        - **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that is optimal regardless of what other players do
        - **Payoff Matrix**: A table showing the outcomes for different strategy combinations
        - **Mixed Strategy**: A probability distribution over pure strategies
